Module 3 Assigment

# PyBank Instructions

* In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyPoll Instructions

* In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

* You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

# Code Source

* Chunks of code in the middle and end of both PyBank and PyPoll were edited with the help of Xpert AI. Notable: syntax for finding changes in profits and losses in PyBank, and finding the percentage of votes each candidate received in PyPoll, as well as exporting the results to a text file and printing them in the Terminal at the same time.
